**Group Number 4:** Claire D, John M. Nadiezhda H, Monica J

# Stock_Analysis
 
**Reason for Topic:** Our team was interested in analyzing stock data and after discussing different options, we decided it would be interesting to see if there is any correlation between stock and gas prices. Gas prices reached an all time high earlier in the year and we all felt the impact. 

**Description of Data Source:** We will be combining S&P 500 index data from Yahoo with weekly gas price data from Kaggle and EIA for the 

1. Stock: [GSPC Weekly Stock Data (2000-2022)](https://github.com/InvestingGroupProject/Investing_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Index%20%26%20Stocks/GSPC_Weekly_stockdata_2000-2022.06.csv) & CVX and XOM Daily Stock Price Open (2000-06/10/2022)
2. Gas: [Weekly US Regular All Formula Price (8/20/1990-8/15/20222)](https://github.com/InvestingGroupProject/Investing_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/GasData/Kaggle_Gas_Data.csv) & [Weekly U.S. Ending Stocks of Total Gasoline (1/5/1990â€“8/12/2022)](https://github.com/InvestingGroupProject/Investing_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/GasData/EIA%20-%20Weekly_U.S._Ending_Stocks_of_Total_Gasoline.csv)

Columns to consider:
1. By Region CA CO FL TX NY All_Grades_All_Formulations_Retail_Gasoline_Prices_Weekly
2. By importing amount
3. By crude oil price and production

**Questions to Answer:**
In addition to understanding if there is a correlation between stock and gas prices, we would also like to use the data to answer the following questions:

1. How has the stock market, specifically S&P500, changed in the last X years?
2. What drives petroleum product prices? 
4. Can we predict gas or stock price behavior? 

**Communication:**
Our team will be commmunicating through slack. We have also scheduled recurring zoom check-ins for Saturdays to help prepare for the week ahead. We have split role responsibilities but are also working together through the dataset and clean up. 

**Group Roles**

   **Square:** The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository. (Week 1 - Monica)
   
   **Triangle:** The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps. (Week 1 - Nadia)

   **Circle:** The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project. (Week 1 - Claire)

   **X:** The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project. (Week 1 - John)
