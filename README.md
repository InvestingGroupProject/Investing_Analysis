# Stock_And_Gas_Analysis
 
**Reason for Topic:** Our team was interested in analyzing stock data and after discussing different options, we decided it would be interesting to see if there is any correlation between stock and gas prices. Gas prices reached an all time high earlier in the year and we all felt the impact. 

**Description of Data Source:** We will be combining S&P 500 index data from Yahoo with weekly gas price data from Kaggle and EIA 

1. Stock: [GSPC Weekly Stock Data (2000-2022)](https://github.com/InvestingGroupProject/Investing_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Index%20%26%20Stocks/GSPC_Weekly_stockdata_2000-2022.06.csv) & CVX and XOM Daily Stock Price Open (2000-06/10/2022)

2. Gas: [Weekly US Regular All Formula Price (8/20/1990-8/15/20222)](https://github.com/InvestingGroupProject/Investing_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/GasData/Kaggle_Gas_Data.csv) & [Weekly U.S. Ending Stocks of Total Gasoline (1/5/1990â€“8/12/2022)](https://github.com/InvestingGroupProject/Investing_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/GasData/EIA%20-%20Weekly_U.S._Ending_Stocks_of_Total_Gasoline.csv)

Columns to consider:
1. By Region CA CO FL TX NY All_Grades_All_Formulations_Retail_Gasoline_Prices_Weekly
2. By importing amount
3. By crude oil price and production

**Questions to Answer:**
In addition to understanding if there is a correlation between stock and gas prices, we would also like to use the data to answer the following questions:

1. How has the stock market, specifically S&P500, changed in the last X years?
2. What drives petroleum product prices? 
4. Can we predict gas or stock price behavior?
